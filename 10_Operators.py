"""
Operators - There are various operators exist in python which are following below:

1) Arithmetic operator
2) Assignment operator
3) Comparision operator
4) Logical operator
5) Identity operator
6) Membership operator
7) Bitwise operator

# Arithmetic operator-  + - * / ** % //

# print("Addition",a+b)
# print("Substraction",a-b)
# print("Product",a*b)
# print("Division",a/b)
# print("Modulus",a%b)
# print("Exponential",a**b)
# print("Floor Integer Value",a//b)

# Comparision operator-  < > <= >= == !=

# print(y<z)
# print(y>z)
# print(y<=z)
# print(y>=z)
# print(y==z)
# print(y!=z)


# Logical operator- and or not

n1 = 25

# print(n1<=40 and n2>=19)
# print(n1<=40 and n2>=15)
# print(n1<=40 or n2>=20)

# Identity operator- is is not

m = 25

# print(m is n)
# print(m is not n)

# Membership operator- in not in

List = [5,6,9,12]

# if 9 in List:
#     print("It is in list")

# if 15 not in List:
#     print("Not in list")

# Bitwise operator-   & | ~

# print(7&3)
# print(7|3)
# print(~7)
