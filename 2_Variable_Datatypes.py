# Type casting - It is a way to change the nature of variable if possible.

c = "45"
d = "85"

# print(c+d)        # str + str = concatenate str

e = int(c)+int(d)

print(e) # This is called type casting as we converted string to integer.


# type() - It shows the class nature of the given variable.

print(type(c+d))

# input() - It is a built in function which takes input from the user or we can say user defined input.
# It always take input as a string that is the main thing needs to be noted.

# Write a program which takes two user defined numbers to add on ?

# n1 = input("Enter the first number\n")
# n2 = input("Enter the second number\n")

# print("Sum:", int(n1)+int(n2))
