"""
Modules - These are those programs which are already written by someone
and they are in their proper form so if we write a code from the scratch
so we can write but our code cannot be better than module as it is written
by experts and there is no sense if you are writing a code for that is
already written.

We can use them in code and use their functions and can do further task
they help us to save time.

There are two types of module :

1) Built in - These are those which are shipped with python installation.
2) External - These are those which we download from an internet using pip.

pip - pip is a package manager which helps us to download external modules
from an internet.

pip install modulename
